Observer Design Pattern Demonstration

The source code for this demo has been adapted from:

	Head First Design Patterns
	Eric & Elisabeth Freeman (with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates)
	ISBN 0-596-00712-4
	2004

and has been edited to include appropriate comments and code adjustments
for Java 5.

The code has already been compiled and run using Ant.  If you don't have Ant,
it can be downloaded from http://ant.apache.org/.  The zip file containing
all the files for this demo have been organized to a specific directory
structure.  Once you unpack all the files, the only editing required
on your part is to specify your particular JDK directory in the
build.properties file.

To run the Swing application:

	C:\tcf\observer> ant runSwing

To run the Weather Data application:

	C:\tcf\observer> ant runWeather

To run the Weather Data application using Observable:

	C:\tcf\observer> ant runWeatherObservable

To re-compile:

	C:\tcf\observer> ant
